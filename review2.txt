The battery life kind of lacks but I have been on it quote a bit. I've become addicted to it learning all the cool features. It being refurbished doesn't even make a difference. Could've fooled me. Looks brand new. Acts brand new. No issues yet but this is my second day of using it. The speaker is awesome. Camera is DOPE. Haven't even learned half of what it can do. SO WORTH IT!!!
