A few hours after writing this review the phone's display started behaving erratically, with its bottom fifth or so flickering bright green when the brightness it set to or near maximum. Contacted Google, and their technicians concluded it is a hardware failure that requires replacement. Well, now at least I know why someone returned this phone in the first place. Truly disappointing
